### Starry Night

**Thats** a nice problem, about a map of stars. Adjacent stars form
clusters and the task is to label them, also 2 clusters are considered
*similar* if they have same shape regardless of their space orientation,
and they must be labeled similarly. The link is'n the description!
Here is a sample input and output:

```JavaScript
==================
=              * =
=   *         ** =
=  ***         * =
=        *       =
=         *      =
=      *  *   *  =
=   ***          =
=             *  =
= **       ***   =
==================

==================
=              a =
=   a         aa =
=  aaa         a =
=        b       =
=         b      =
=      c  b   d  =
=   ccc          =
=             c  =
= ee       ccc   =
==================
```
